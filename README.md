Plate Bestie
Gemini 3 Global Hackathon | Martian Xeno-Botany Assistant

Plate Bestie leverages Gemini 3 Flash to help Martian settlers diagnose plant health and optimize "Life-Support Zones" in pressurized habitats.

Key Features
Multimodal Diagnostics: Real-time analysis of crops (Dwarf Tomatoes, Peppers, Strawberries) to identify stressors like Nitrogen deficiency or water stress.

Habitat Scanning: Uses the Gemini 3 vision engine to map out "Growth Zones" and life-support efficiency within a room.

Survival Chat: A direct conversational uplink for immediate botanical care protocols and survival instructions.

Mission Deployment Notes
Mission Telemetry: The "Archives" section contains Simulated Mission Logs. These are high-level data placeholders designed to demonstrate the app's UI scaling over a multi-year Martian harvest cycle.

Atmospheric Lighting: The demo video is filmed in low-light conditions to simulate the specific LUX intensity found inside a pressurized Martian "Bio-Dome."

Live Uplink: All Live Scans and Real-Time Chats are fully operational, demonstrating the raw power of the Gemini 3 Flash multimodal engine.
